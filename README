### Depricated

This package is now depricated.  R can natively support interactions with
twitter, flickr, wordpress, and many other APIs through native packages.
For instance, see the [twitteR](http://cran.at.r-project.org/web/packages/twitteR/), 
[Rflickr, Rdropbox, RMendeley and RWordpress](https://github.com/duncantl) packages.
